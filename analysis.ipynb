This is likely driven by a combination of factors including ambient inflation, rising disposable incomes leading to greater demand for luxury goods, and potentially more volatile supply chains for these specialized items.\n\nFor farmers and exporters, this indicates that the highest potential for revenue growth lies in the cultivation and trade of high-value, non-staple commodities.","metadata":{}},{"id":"b2426f39","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Analysis of Top Commodity Prices in the Most Recent Year (2024)\n\n#### Business Query:\n*Which 3 commodities had the highest average `Modal_Price` in 2024?*\n\nThis analysis identifies the most expensive commodities based on their average market price in the most recent full year of data.","metadata":{}},{"id":"9c830a5c","cell_type":"code","source":"# Filter the DataFrame to include only data from the year 2024.\ndf_2024 = df_master[df_master['Year'] == 2024]\n\n# Group the 2024 data by 'Commodity', calculate the mean of 'Modal_Price' for each,\n# sort the results in descending order, and select the top 3.\ntop_3_highest_price_commodities_2024 = df_2024.groupby('Commodity').agg(\n    avg_modal_price_2024=('Modal_Price', 'mean')\n).sort_values(by='avg_modal_price_2024', ascending=False).head(3)\n\n# Display the final result.\nprint(\"--- Top 3 Most Expensive Commodities by Average Price in 2024 ---\")\nprint(top_3_highest_price_commodities_2024.to_string(float_format='₹{:,.2f}'.format))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-07T17:57:30.721351Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-07T17:57:30.721500Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-07T17:57:31.455904Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-07T17:57:30.721486Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-07T17:57:31.455133Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"--- Top 3 Most Expensive Commodities by Average Price in 2024 ---\n             avg_modal_price_2024\nCommodity                        \nSaffron               ₹292,139.28\nCardamoms             ₹191,437.35\npoppy seeds            ₹93,352.90\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":4},{"id":"bb28fb66","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Conclusion & Interpretation\n\nThe analysis pinpoints the three commodities with the highest monetary value in the 2024 market.\n\n| Commodity | Average Modal Price (2024) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Saffron** | **₹292,139.28** |\n| **Cardamoms** | **₹191,437.35** |\n| **Poppy Seeds** | **₹93,352.90** |\n\nThe results clearly show that high-value spices are the most expensive commodities. **Saffron**, known as one of the most expensive spices in the world, leads with an average price of over **₹2.9 lakh**. **Cardamoms** follows at over **₹1.9 lakh**.\n\nThis information is critical for traders and exporters who specialize in high-margin, premium agricultural products.","metadata":{}},{"id":"c5b596bb","cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Sub-Analysis: Price Trend by Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)\n\nWhile the absolute price increase is informative, the **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)** offers a more standardized measure of investment return.

This can be attributed to heavy rains disrupting transportation and logistics, which can lead to temporary, localized supply shortages and subsequent price increases.\n\n#### Actionable Insight:\nInstead of a single period of inflation, cooperatives and policymakers should anticipate and prepare for two primary high-risk windows: the **peak winter months (December-January)** and the **peak monsoon month (July)**.

In **Kottayam**, the price for tomatoes was above ₹3,000 on **345 different days**, which is nearly every day the market was recorded. This is not an indicator of temporary volatility, but rather a sustained, year-round premium price environment.\n\n*   **Strong Regional Concentration:** All three top markets—Kottayam, Kanjirappally, and Anchal—are located in **Kerala**. This points to a clear, state-wide market dynamic where tomato prices are structurally higher than in the rest of the country, likely due to a combination of high local demand, logistical costs, and regional consumption patterns.\n\n#### Actionable Insight for Stakeholders:\nFor tomato producers and distributors, the state of Kerala, and specifically the **Kottayam** market, represents the most significant and reliable opportunity for achieving premium price realization in India. Unlike markets that experience occasional price spikes, these locations offer consistent, high prices, making them a prime strategic target for supply contracts and distribution efforts.","metadata":{}}]}
